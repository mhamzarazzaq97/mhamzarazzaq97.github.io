{\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=0.6cm,topsep=5pt, itemsep=2pt, parsep=2pt, label={\textbullet}]
    \item Leading and mentoring a team of 5 DevOps engineers responsible for managing 15+ production and non-production environments, overseeing component upgrades, releases, feature development, and continuous improvements to the infrastructure codebase.
    \item Maintaining 99.9\% uptime while leading critical services upgrades (EKS, RDS, MSK) with zero downtime and no data loss.
    \item Cut infrastructure provisioning from hours to minutes by building a GitLab pipeline framework orchestrating 15+ Terraform repos.
    \item Achieved 35-40\% monthly cost savings (\$70K+/month) by developing an in-house 'Environment Scaler' tool that automatically downscales non-production environments during off-hours.
    \item Reduced critical CVEs through comprehensive cluster security implementation including Kyverno policy enforcement, Trivy vulnerability scanning, and automated AMI patching via Karpenter.
    \item Serving as primary escalation point for complex production incidents, conducting deep-dive root cause analysis across distributed systems to identify issues spanning multiple services, clusters, and AWS components.
    \item Reduced deployment time by 30-40\% by refactoring deployment strategy to decouple infrastructure and application releases, enabling independent and faster change rollouts.
    \item Eliminated 30 minutes of manual IRSA updates per deployment by migrating to EKS Pod Identity, simplifying IAM management for microservices across all environments.
    \item Improved cluster autoscaling efficiency by migrating from AWS Auto Scaling Groups to Karpenter and implementing event-driven scaling with KEDA, reducing response time to traffic spikes.
